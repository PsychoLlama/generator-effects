  <h1>Effect Runtime</h1>
  <p>A proof-of-concept generator runtime for IO encapsulation.</p>
</div>

## Purpose
Code is easier to manage when you isolate effects from business logic. The effect runtime is an experiment to turn effects into data structures yielded from generators, providing perfect isolation from the rest of the system.

This isn't a new idea. Functional languages have been doing it since the dawn of time. I was just curious what it would look like in JavaScript.
